## Introduction

ArduinoLang is a library with headers which translate C++ 
and Wiring reserved words, to other languages different of
english. To accomplish this, each header use macro in
combination with some typedefs, those little tricks make
the proccess of learn how to write code for Arduino
easier.

The complete list for languages accepted to this momment 
is available bellow, please submit pull requests with 
more language and spread the world with the hashtag
\#codeglobalization to make people see that we need to
start write code in different languages.

## List of available languages

The languages available are:

* Portugues (under construction)
* Español (not available)
