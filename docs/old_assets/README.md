# Arduino Lang Documentation

Documentation for ArduinoLang on several languages

## Introduction

This is a work in progress of the documentation part of the process
of translating languages to something more "native".

The dream of ArduinoLang project is to convert not only the
Arduino, but every programming language to something that
you can use it without having to learn a new language. With
this in mind, we want to make programming something more suitable for the <elderly>, or even people that live in <unprivileged> places, to learn how to program, without having to learn a new language.

In the first moment we are aiming all compiled languages
like C/C++, Java, Swift and Go, but as long we improve
our method, we aim to interpreted languages too, like Lua,
Ruby and Python. We believe that making languages more 
natural, is not a problem as it was before, like in decade 
of 70s, 80s or 90s. Now our computers
are much more capable \o/, and suffer or need a little more
resources aren't a big problem even in ambients different
of the education.

The main goal of a project like this is improve the 
proccess of learning how to code, but with a different
aspect, instead of learn a bunch of reserved words in
english in some moments without even knowing the meaning
of this, we convert those words to the native language
of the programmer, not using an external piece of 
software, but just with a library, and anything more.

We believe that a programming language NEED to be not 
only understandable by everyone but clear to the people
that are programming this, and this effort begun, when
a university colleague at some class asked my:

**"If you are brazillian, for what the fuck reason you 
are programming (with variables) in english?"**

This lead me to ask, why everyone make this?

Why am I programming in english for the last 5 years?

Why even programming languages created on Brazil are
made on english?

I know "globalization" could be your first thougt 
but make languages clear for everyone in the world is
really necessary for EVERYTHING? Isn't possible that
people can write in portuguese some code and you know
use the GCC preprocessor to expand the variables to the
real code? Is really necessary that even with such
mechanism you habitant of argentina, chile, mexico,
china, russia, germany, even with such method you really
need to continue writing code in english?

I think it no! And like text but different of this 
because you don't have ambiguous code, you can
convert with a 100% accurate conversion, code that
is writting with....
